This is the course website for the {{< var course.semester >}} edition of {{< var course.number >}}, {{< var course.title >}}, taught at [{{< var university.name >}}]({{< var university.url >}}) by [{{< var instructor.name_no_title >}}]({{< var instructor.url >}}).

## Course Information

- Details on the class and course policies are provided in the [syllabus](syllabus.html).
- Topics and weekly materials can be found in the [schedule](schedule.html).

## Software Tools

- This course will use the [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language. Julia is a modern, free, open source language which is designed for scientific computing. No prior knowledge of Julia is required. My recommendation is to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [official Julia extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia) for coding.
- Assignments will be distributed using [GitHub Classroom](https://github.com). You should create a GitHub account, but we will walk through how to use it.
