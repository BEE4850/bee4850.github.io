We'll also use 4 chains so we can test that the chains are well-mixed, and each chain will be run for 5,000 iterations^[Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers often need to be run for fewer iterations than Metropolis-Hastings samplers, as the exploratory step uses information about the gradient of the statistical model, versus the random walk of Metropolis-Hastings. The disadvantage is that this gradient information must be available, which is not always the case for external simulation models.

        "\n",
        "Let's now look at an example of fitting an extreme value distribution (namely, a [generalized extreme value distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_extreme_value_distribution), or GEV) to tide gauge data. GEV distributions have three parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "- $\\mu$, the *location* parameter, which reflects the positioning of the bulk of the GEV distribution;\n",
        "- $\\sigma$, the *scale* parameter, which reflects the width of the bulk;\n",
        "- $\\xi$, the *shape* parameter, which reflects the thickness and boundedness of the tail.\n",
        "\n",
        "The shape parameter $\\xi$ is often of interest, as there are three classes of GEV distributions corresponding to different signs:\n",
        "\n",
        "- $\\xi < 0$ means that the distribution is bounded;\n",
        "- $\\xi = 0$ means that the distribution has a thinner tail, so the \"extreme extremes\" are less likely;\n",
        "- $\\xi > 0$ means that the distribution has a thicker tail.\n",
