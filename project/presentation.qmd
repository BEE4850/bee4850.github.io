These are the instructions for your final project presentation, which will be given in class on **May 6, 2024**. 

## Presentation Submission

Please submit your slides in PDF format by email to Prof. Srikrishnan no later than **Friday, May 3, 2024**. 

## Presentation Guidelines

Your presentation should be short (10 minutes, which will be timed and strictly enforced in the interest of time). Your presentation should *concisely* describe your key question, your scientific hypothesis, and your results and conclusions. Note that a 10 minute presentation means that you should aim for no more than 5-6 slides (not including titles, transitions, or wrap-ups/references).
