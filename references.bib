  author   = "Arns, A and Wahl, T and Haigh, I D and Jensen, J and
              Pattiaratchi, C",
  abstract = "Over the past five decades, several approaches for estimating
              probabilities of extreme still water levels have been developed.
              Currently, different methods are applied not only on
              transnational, but also on national scales, resulting in a
              heterogeneous level of protection. Applying different statistical
              methods can yield significantly different estimates of return
              water levels, but even the use of the same technique can produce
              large discrepancies, because there is subjective parameter choice
              at several steps in the model setup. In this paper, we compare
              probabilities of extreme still water levels estimated using the
              main direct methods (i.e. the block maxima method and the peaks
              over threshold method) considering a wide range of strategies to
              create extreme value dataset and a range of different model
              setups. We primarily use tide gauge records from the German Bight
              but also consider data from sites around the UK and Australia for
              comparison. The focus is on testing the influence of the
              following three main factors, which can affect the estimates of
              extreme value statistics: (1) detrending the original data sets;
              (2) building samples of extreme values from the original data
              sets; and (3) the record lengths of the original data sets. We
              find that using different detrending techniques biases the
              results from extreme value statistics. Hence, we recommend using
              a 1-year moving average of high waters (or hourly records if
              these are available) to correct the original data sets for
              seasonal and long-term sea level changes. Our results highlight
              that the peaks over threshold method yields more reliable and
              more stable (i.e. using short records leads to the same results
              as when using long records) estimates of probabilities of extreme
              still water levels than the block maxima method. In analysing a
              variety of threshold selection methods we find that using the
              99.7th percentile water level leads to the most stable return
              water level estimates along the German Bight. This is also valid
              for the international stations considered. Finally, to provide
              guidance for coastal engineers and operators, we recommend the
              peaks over threshold method and define an objective approach for
              setting up the model. If this is applied routinely around a
              country, it will help overcome the problem of heterogeneous
              levels of protection resulting from different methods and varying
              model setups.",

              We suggest instead to use a uniform prior on the hierarchical

              groups is small and in other settings where a weakly informative

  systematic treatment of uncertainty in model-based decision support activities
  such as policy analysis, integrated assessment and risk assessment. It focuses
  on the uncertainty perceived from the point of view of those providing
  information to support policy decisions (i.e., the modellers? view on
  uncertainty) ? uncertainty regarding the analytical outcomes and conclusions
  of the decision support exercise. Within the regulatory and management
  sciences, there is neither commonly shared terminology nor full agreement on a
  typology of uncertainties. Our aim is to synthesise a wide variety of
  contributions on uncertainty in model-based decision support in order to
  provide an interdisciplinary theoretical framework for systematic uncertainty
  analysis. To that end we adopt a general definition of uncertainty as being
  any deviation from the unachievable ideal of completely deterministic
  knowledge of the relevant system. We further propose to discriminate among
  three dimensions of uncertainty: location, level and nature of uncertainty,
  and we harmonise existing typologies to further detail the concepts behind
  these three dimensions of uncertainty. We propose an uncertainty matrix as a
  heuristic tool to classify and report the various dimensions of uncertainty,
  thereby providing a conceptual framework for better communication among
  analysts as well as between them and policymakers and stakeholders.
  Understanding the various dimensions of uncertainty helps in identifying,
  articulating, and prioritising critical uncertainties, which is a crucial step
  to more adequate acknowledgement and treatment of uncertainty in decision
  support endeavours and more focused research on complex, inherently uncertain,
  policy issues.},
