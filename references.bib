  abstract = "Over the past five decades, several approaches for estimating
              probabilities of extreme still water levels have been developed.
              Currently, different methods are applied not only on
              transnational, but also on national scales, resulting in a
              heterogeneous level of protection. Applying different statistical
              methods can yield significantly different estimates of return
              water levels, but even the use of the same technique can produce
              large discrepancies, because there is subjective parameter choice
              at several steps in the model setup. In this paper, we compare
              probabilities of extreme still water levels estimated using the
              main direct methods (i.e. the block maxima method and the peaks
              over threshold method) considering a wide range of strategies to
              create extreme value dataset and a range of different model
              setups. We primarily use tide gauge records from the German Bight
              but also consider data from sites around the UK and Australia for
              comparison. The focus is on testing the influence of the
              following three main factors, which can affect the estimates of
              extreme value statistics: (1) detrending the original data sets;
              (2) building samples of extreme values from the original data
              sets; and (3) the record lengths of the original data sets. We
              find that using different detrending techniques biases the
              results from extreme value statistics. Hence, we recommend using
              a 1-year moving average of high waters (or hourly records if
              these are available) to correct the original data sets for
              seasonal and long-term sea level changes. Our results highlight
              that the peaks over threshold method yields more reliable and
              more stable (i.e. using short records leads to the same results
              as when using long records) estimates of probabilities of extreme
              still water levels than the block maxima method. In analysing a
              variety of threshold selection methods we find that using the
              99.7th percentile water level leads to the most stable return
              water level estimates along the German Bight. This is also valid
              for the international stations considered. Finally, to provide
              guidance for coastal engineers and operators, we recommend the
              peaks over threshold method and define an objective approach for
              setting up the model. If this is applied routinely around a
              country, it will help overcome the problem of heterogeneous
              levels of protection resulting from different methods and varying
              model setups.",

              noninformative and weakly informative priors in this family. We
              use an example to illustrate serious problems with the

              We suggest instead to use a uniform prior on the hierarchical
              standard deviation, using the half-$t$ family when the number of
              groups is small and in other settings where a weakly informative
