# Course Overview

## About Me

**Instructor**: Prof. Vivek Srikrishnan, [viveks@cornell.edu](mailto:viveks@cornell.edu)

**Interests**:

- Bridging Earth science, data science, and decision science to improve climate risk management;
- Unintended consequences which result from neglecting uncertainty or system dynamics.

Take a moment, write it down, and we'll share!

# Course Motivation

## Why Does Data Analysis Matter?

- Scientific insight;
- Decision-making;
- Understanding uncertainty

## The Ideal

## But in Actuality

- Except in the most controlled experiments, **data are noisy**;
- The **causes** of the data cannot be extracted from the data alone;
- The **reasons** for statistical analyses are not found in the data themselves.

## Unique/Challenging Features Of Data

There are many features of environmental (and biological!) data which make data analysis interesting and hard.

## Extreme Events

## Causation Is Not Association

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- We've all heard "correlation (**association**) does not imply causation"
- But confounds/noise can mean **causation does not imply association**

## Description and Inference are Connected
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
Except for superficial tasks: 

- Knowing what is important to describe requires a model;
- Understanding how the data might differ from the population requires a model.

## Some Problems With The "Standard" Data Analysis Toolkit

::: {.incremental}
- Statistical assumptions may not be valid;
- "Null" vs "Alternative" hypotheses and tests may be chosen for computational convenience, not scientific relevance.
- Many different **substantive** models can imply the same **statistical** model.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Important**: "Big" data doesn't solve the problem!
:::

## My Philosophical Position

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- Probability theory helps us deduce logical implications of theories **conditional on our assumptions**
- Cannot use an "objective" procedure to avoid **subjective responsibility**

## Model-Based Data Analysis

We can (**transparently**):

- Examine logical implications of model assumptions (**including interventions/out-of-sample generation**).
- Assess evidence for multiple hypotheses by generating simulated data.
- Identify opportunities to design future experiments or observations to distinguish between competing hypotheses.

## Model-Based Data Analysis

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
Models are how we assess evidence for theories.

# Course Policies

## Background Knowledge: Computing

- Basics (at the level of CS 111x)
- No specific language requirement.
- Some extra work/effort may be needed if you haven't coded in a while.
- May need some additional familiarity with statistical packages (and "light" optimization)

## Background Knowledge: Probability/Statistics

- ENGRD 2700/CEE 3040
- Summary statistics of data
- Probability distributions
- Basic visualizations
- Monte Carlo basics


## Grades

| Assessment | % of Grade |
|:-----------|-----------:|
| Participation | 10% |
| Readings | 10% |
| Literature Critique | 15% |
| Homework Assignments | 40% |
| Term Project | 25% |


## Overall Guidelines

- Collaboration *highly* encouraged, but **all work must reflect your own understanding**
- Submit PDFs on Gradescope
- 50% penalty for late submission (up to 24 hours)
- Standard rubric available on website
- **Always cite external references**

## Literature Critique

- Select a paper which involves some type of statistical or data analysis
- Critique choices: do they support the scientific conclusions?
- Submit a 2 page writeup at the end of the semester
- If you're unsure where to look for a paper, talk to Prof. Srikrishnan and we can find options

## Readings

- Several readings assigned for discussion throughout the semester.
- Annotation assignments on Canvas: by end of day on a Monday.
- One (graduate) student responsible for leading the discussion on that Wednesday.
- If you want to use slides, send them to Prof. Srikrishnan by end of day Tuesday.

## Homework Assignments

- More in-depth problems
- Roughly 2 weeks to complete
- Will drop one by default
- Regrade requests must be made within one week
- **5850 Students**: Some extra problems

## Term Project

- Analyze a data set of interest using model(s) of your choice
- Can work individually or groups of 2
- Several deliverables throughout the semester
- Final in-class presentation and report

## Attendance

Not required, but students tend to do better when they're actively engaged in class.


## Office Hours

- MW 1-2 PM, 318 Riley-Robb
- Almost impossible to find a time that works for all (or even most); please feel free to make appointments as/if needed.

## Accomodations

If you have any access barriers in this class, *please* seek out any helpful accomodations.

- Get an SDS letter.
- If you need an accomodation before you have an official letter, please reach out to me ASAP!


## Academic Integrity

Hopefully not a concern...

- Collaboration is great and is encouraged! 
- Knowing how to find and use helpful resources is a skill we want to develop. 
- Don't just copy...learn from others and give credit.
- Submit your own original work.


## Academic Integrity

Obviously, just copying down answers from Chegg or ChatGPT and passing them off as your own is not ok.


## ChatGPT: The Stochastic Parrot

Think about ChatGPT as a drunk who tells stories for drinks.

It will give you plausible-looking text or code on any topic, but it doesn't know anything beyond what it "overheard."

::: {.callout-caution}
ChatGPT can be useful for certain tasks (*e.g.* understanding code errors), but may neglect context for why/when certain information or solutions work.

Just think about it as an unreliable Google search.
:::

## ChatGPT: The Stochastic Parrot

Must specifically call out where you used ChatGPT in your work (beyond simple referencing).

# Class Tools

## Communications

Use [Ed Discussion](https://us.edstem.org) for questions and discussions about class, homework assignments, etc.

- Try to use public posts so others can benefit from questions and can weigh in.
- **I will make announcements through Ed**.

## Email

When urgency or privacy is required, email is ok.

::: {.callout-important}
Please include **BEE4850** in your email subject line! This will ensure it doesn't get lost in the shuffle.

Better: Use Ed Discussion and reserve email for matters that are particular urgent and/or require privacy.
:::

## Course Website

<https://viveks.me/simulation-data-analysis>

- Central hub for information, schedule, and policies
- Will add link and some information to Canvas (assignment due dates, etc)

## Computing Tools

- Course is programming language-agnostic.
- Assignments will have notebooks set up for Julia (environments, etc) on GitHub.

## Some Tips For Success

- Start the homeworks early; this gives time to sort out conceptual problems and debug.
- Ask questions (in class and online) and try to help each other.
- Give me feedback!

# Upcoming Schedule

## Next Classes

- Hypothesis testing and decision-making
- Generative models

## Assessments

**Homework 1** available; due *next* Friday (2/7).
