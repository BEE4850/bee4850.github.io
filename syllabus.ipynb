        "Simulations from numerical and statistical models are a key tool used to quantify and represent our understanding of many different environmental systems, including but not limited to the climate, sea levels, air pollution, and the electric power system. Data analysis of environmental observations and model simulations is an integral part of developing and evaluating models used to 1) test our assumptions about environmental system dynamics; 2) develop new insights into environmental processes; and 3) project future environmental conditions and outcomes. understand system dynamics and project future conditions and outcomes. This course will provide an overview of the use of simulation model development and evaluation in environmental data analysis. The goal is to provide students with a framework and an initial toolkit of methods that they can use to formulate and update hypotheses about data and models. Students will actively analyze and use real data from a variety of environmental systems. In particular, over the course of the semester, we will:\n",

I will put as many course materials, such as lecture notes and announcements, as possible online, but viewing materials online is not the same as active participation and engagement.

This includes analyses,  code,  software  runs,  and  reports. Engineering as a profession relies upon the honesty and integrity of its practitioners (see *e.g.* the [American Society for Civil Engineers' Code of Ethics](https://www.asce.org/-/media/asce-images-and-files/career-and-growth/ethics/documents/asce-code-ethics.pdf)).\n",

Plagiarism occurs when a writer intentionally misrepresents another's words or ideas (including code!) as their own without acknowledging the source.  **All** external resources which are consulted while working on an assignment should be referenced, including other students and faculty with whom the assignment is discussed. You will never be penalized for consulting an external source for help and referencing it, but plagiarism will result in a zero for that assignment as well as the potential for your case to be passed on for additional disciplinary action.\n",

Please reach out *ahead of time* if you have extenuating circumstances (including University-approved absences or illnesses) which would make it difficult for you to submit your work on time. Note that *e.g.* job interviews or a busy schedule outside of this course are not valid reasons for extensions. If an extension is granted, any late penalties will be waived up to the extension date.

        "### Application Exercises: 10%\n",
        "\n",
        "Most weeks, students will be given a set of exercises (typically involving analyzing a dataset, a model, or a figure) to complete. These will involve a small amount of programming, a minor calculation,  and/or visual assessment of data or a figure. Application exercises will be provided the previous Monday and are intended to align with the content for the week, and solutions should be submitted by 9:00pm on the Friday at the end of the given week. These exercises will be given as quizzes on Gradescope and will be auto-graded. The lowest exercise score will be dropped automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Readings: 10%\n",
        "\n",
        "Readings will be assigned for discussion throughout the semester. One student will be responsible for writing an initial summary and critique of the paper, but all students are expected to contribute to in-class and online discussions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Paper Critique and Presentation: 20%\n",
        "\n",
        "Students will select a peer-reviewed journal article related to an application of data analysis and will write a short discussion paper analyzing the hypotheses and statistical choices. Students enrolled in BEE 5850 will also write a referee report, as if they were a peer reviewer. Students will give an in-class presentation of their paper during one class period. Other students will be asked to submit evaluations of the presentations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Homework Assignments: 30%\n",
        "\n",
        "Approximately 6 homework assignments will be assigned throughout the semester (roughly one per course module). You will typically have 2 weeks to work on each assignment, though this depends on the module length. Students are encouraged to collaborate and learn from each other on homework assignments, but each student must submit their own solutions reflecting their understanding of the material. Consulting and referencing external resources and your peers is encouraged (engineering is a collaborative discipline!), but  plagiarism is a violation of academic integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some notes on assignment and grading logistics:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Homeworks are due by 9:00pm Eastern Time on the designed due date. Your assignment notebook (which include your writeup and codes) should be submitted to Gradescope as a PDF with the answers to each question tagged (a failure to do this will result in deductions). \n",
        "  * Rubrics will be provided for the homeworks as part of the assignments.\n",
        "  * Students in 5850 will be asked to complete additional homework problems which go more deeply into the underlying concepts or apply more advanced techniques.\n",
        "  * Your lowest homework grade will be dropped. We can discuss arrangements if multiple assignments will be missed for university-approved reasons, preferably ahead of time. \n",
        "  * Regrade requests for specific problems must be made within a week of the grading of that assignment. However, note that regrades can cut both ways: the TA can take away points as well!\n",
        "\n",
        "### Term Project: 30%\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the semester, students will apply the concepts and methods from class to a data set of their choosing. If a student does not have a data set in mind, we will find one which aligns with their interests.\n",
        "\n",
        "The term project can be completed individually or in groups of 2. Students will provide updates throughout the semester corresponding to the various tasks discussed in each module and will submit a final report at the end of the semester. The deliverables are:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * A proposal describing the research question and hypotheses, the data set, and the numerical or statistical models the student would like to use to test the hypotheses;\n",
        "  * A simulation study applying simulation methods to the models;\n",
        "  * A calibration exercises applying calibration and uncertainty quantification methods from class;\n",
        "  * Assessments of the model performance based on the data;\n",
        "  * A final presentation and report.\n",
