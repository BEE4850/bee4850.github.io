  - Bankes, S. (1993). Exploratory modeling for policy analysis. Operations Research, 41(3), 435â€“449. <https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.41.3.435>

  As you're reading, please use the collaborative annotation in Canvas to make notes and read and respond to others' thoughts and questions. We will discuss the paper in the 03/10 class period. You will be graded based on annotation and participation in the discussion.

  In particular, please focus on:

  * What are the differences between consolidative and exploratory modeling?
  * What is the relationship between exploratory modeling and the types of model-based analyses we are discussing in class?
  * How can exploratory modeling be used in conjunction with or instead of Monte Carlo when we don't have well-defined input distributions?
  * How might sensitivity analysis fit into our modeling workflows?
  * How do different exploratory modeling types reflect different goals and questions, and what are the implications for modeling or data analysis approaches?
