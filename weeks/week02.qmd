  As you're reading, please use the collaborative annotation in Canvas to make notes and read and respond to others' thoughts and questions. We will discuss the paper in the 02/03 class period. You will be graded based on annotation and participation in the discussion.

  In particular, please focus on:

  * How does the framing of climate change attribution relate to the Type I/Type II error framework we discussed in class?
  * What are the implications of the storyline approach for statements about climate attribution of extreme events?
  * What are your thoughts on the storyline vs. FAR approach for scientific insights and communication of climate impacts?
