## Readings

As you're reading along, please use the collaborative annotation in Canvas to make notes and read and respond to others' thoughts and questions. Post a summary of key points, takeaways, and thoughts on Ed Discussion and be prepared to engage in the discussion on-line. We will dedicate class time to this reading on Wednesday, so make sure you've read it, though you'll have more time to finalize your thoughts for the online.
