About Me\n\n**Instructor**: Prof. Vivek Srikrishnan, [viveks@cornell.edu](mailto:viveks@cornell.edu)\n\n**Interests**:\n\n- Bridging Earth science, data science, and decision science to improve climate risk management;\n- Unintended consequences which result from neglecting uncertainty or system dynamics.\n\n## Meet My Supervisors\n\n::: {.center}\n![My Supervisors](figures/cats.png){width=30%}\n:::\n\n## What Do You Hope To Get Out Of This Course?\n\nTake a moment, write it down, and we'll share!\n\n# Course Motivation\n\n## Why Does Data Analysis Matter?\n\n- Scientific insight;\n- Decision-making;\n- Understanding uncertainty\n\n## The Ideal\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=50%}\n**Goal**: Obtain data that is so self-evident that you don't need to do statistics!\n:::\n::: {.column width=50%}\n![XKCD 2400](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/statistics.png){width=60%}\n\n::: {.caption}\nSource: [XKCD 2400](https://xkcd.com/2400/)\n:::\n:::\n::::\n\n## But in Actuality\n\n- Except in the most controlled experiments, **data are noisy**;\n- The **causes** of the data cannot be extracted from the data alone;\n- The **reasons** for statistical analyses are not found in the data themselves.\n\n## Unique/Challenging Features Of Data\n\nThere are many features of environmental (and biological!) data which make data analysis interesting and hard.\n\n## Extreme Events\n\n::: {.center}\n![Extreme Events](figures/dossgollin-keller-2023_extreme.jpeg)\n:::\n::: {.caption}\nSource:

Uncertainty\n\n::: {.center}\n![Deep Uncertainty for Future Climate Projections](figures/srikrishnan-etal-2022_co2.png)\n:::\n::: {.caption}\nSource: @Srikrishnan2022-yq\n:::\n\n## Causation Is Not Association\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=50%}\n- We've all heard \"correlation (**association**) does not imply causation\"\n- But confounds/noise can mean **causation does not imply association**\n:::\n::: {.column width=50%}\n\n::: {.center}\n![Correlation not Causation Meme](memes/causation_not_correlation.jpg){width=60%}\n:::\n::: {.caption}\nSource: Richard McElreath\n:::\n\n:::\n::::\n\n## Description and Inference are Connected\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=50%}\nExcept for superficial tasks: \n\n- Knowing what is important to describe requires a model;\n- Understanding how the data might differ from the population requires a model.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=50%}\n::: {.center}\n![Spidermen Meme](memes/spidermen-description-inference.jpg){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n::::\n\n## Some Problems With The \"Standard\" Data Analysis Toolkit\n\n::: {.incremental}\n- Statistical assumptions may not be valid;\n- \"Null\" vs \"Alternative\" hypotheses and tests may be chosen for computational convenience, not scientific relevance.\n- Many different **substantive** models can imply the same **statistical** model.\n:::\n\n::: {.fragment .fade-in}\n**Important**: \"Big\" data doesn't solve the problem!\n:::\n\n## My Philosophical Position\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=50%}\n- Probability theory helps us deduce logical implications of theories **conditional on our assumptions**\n- Cannot use an \"objective\" procedure to avoid **subjective responsibility**\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=50%}\n::: {.center}\n![Bart Statistics Meme](memes/peter_parker_method_assumptions.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n::::\n\n## Model-Based Data Analysis\n\nWe can (**transparently**):\n\n- Examine logical implications of model assumptions (**including interventions/out-of-sample generation**).\n- Assess evidence for multiple hypotheses by generating simulated data.\n- Identify opportunities to design future experiments or observations to distinguish between competing hypotheses.\n\n## Model-Based Data Analysis\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=50%}\nModels are how we assess evidence for theories.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=50%}\n::: {.center}\n![Rock Paper Scissors meme](memes/rock-paper-theory-model.jpg){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n::::\n\n## Course Organization\n\n```{mermaid}\ntimeline\n      Introduction (Weeks 1-2): Overview\n                  : Hypothesis Testing and Scientific Inference\n      Probability Fundamentals (Weeks 2-5):

haven't coded in a while.\n- May need some additional familiarity with statistical packages (and \"light\" optimization)\n\n## Background Knowledge: Probability/Statistics\n\n- ENGRD 2700/CEE 3040\n- Summary statistics of data\n- Probability distributions\n- Basic visualizations\n- Monte Carlo basics\n\n\n## Grades\n\n| Assessment | Weight |\n|:-----------|-----------:|\n| Participation | 5% |\n| Readings | 10% |\n| Quizzes | 10% |\n| Literature Critique | 15% |\n| Homework Assignments | 30% |\n| Term Project | 30% |\n\n\n## Overall Guidelines\n\n- Collaboration *highly* encouraged, but **all work must reflect your own understanding**\n- Submit PDFs on Gradescope\n- 50% penalty for late submission (up to 24 hours)\n- Standard rubric available on website\n- **Always cite external references**\n\n## Literature Critique\n\n- Select a paper which involves some type of statistical or data analysis\n- Critique choices: do they support the scientific conclusions?\n- Submit a 2-3 page writeup at the end of the semester\n- If you're unsure where to look for a paper, talk to Prof. Srikrishnan\n\n## Readings\n\n- Several readings assigned for discussion throughout the semester.\n- Annotation assignments on Canvas: by end of the week.\n- Will discuss paper at start of class next Monday.\n- **5850 students**: Write a one-page summary.\n\n## Quizzes\n\n- Assigned on Gradescope (almost) weekly.\n- Short (2-3 problems), focused on material from that week.\n- Due before class next Monday.\n\n## Homework Assignments\n\n- More in-depth problems\n- Roughly 2 weeks to complete\n- Regrade requests must be made within one week\n- **5850 Students**: Some extra problems\n\n## Term Project\n\n- Analyze a data set of interest using model(s) of your choice\n- Can work individually or groups of 2\n- Several deliverables throughout the semester\n- Final in-class presentation and report\n\n## Attendance\n\nNot required, but students tend to do better when they're actively engaged in class.\n\n\n## Office Hours\n\n- **Instructor**: MW 1-2 PM, 318 Riley-Robb\n- **TA**: MTh 10:30-11:30 AM, 319 Riley-Robb\n- Almost impossible to find a time that works for all (or even most); please feel free to make appointments as/if needed.\n\n## Accomodations\n\nIf you have any access barriers in this class, *please* seek out any helpful accomodations.\n\n- Get an SDS letter.\n- If you need an accomodation before you have an official letter, please reach out to me ASAP!\n\n\n## Academic Integrity\n\nHopefully not a concern...\n\n- Collaboration is great and is encouraged! \n- Knowing how to find and use helpful resources is a skill we want to develop. \n- Don't just copy...learn from others and give credit.\n- Submit your own original work.\n\n\n## Academic Integrity\n\nObviously, just copying down answers from Chegg or ChatGPT and passing them off as your own is not ok.\n\n\n## LLMs: Bullshit Generators\n\nThink about ChatGPT as a drunk who tells stories for drinks.\n\nIt will give you plausible-looking text or code on any topic, but it doesn't know anything beyond what it \"overheard.\"\n\nChatGPT can be useful for certain tasks (*e.g.* understanding code errors), but may neglect context for why/when certain information or solutions work.\n\n## ChatGPT: The Stochastic Parrot\n\nMust specifically call out where you used ChatGPT in your work (beyond simple referencing; see syllabus for details).\n\n# Class Tools\n\n## Communications\n\nUse [Ed Discussion](https://us.edstem.org) for questions and discussions about class, homework assignments, etc.\n\n- Try to use public posts so others can benefit from questions and can weigh in.\n- **I will make announcements through Ed**.\n\n## Email\n\nWhen urgency or privacy is required, email is ok.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nPlease include **BEE4850** in your email subject line! This will ensure it doesn't get lost in the shuffle.\n\nBetter: Use Ed Discussion and reserve email for matters that are particular urgent and/or require privacy.\n:::\n\n## Course Website\n\n<https://viveks.me/simulation-data-analysis>\n\n- Central hub for information, schedule, and policies\n- Will add link and some information to Canvas (assignment due dates, etc)\n\n## Computing Tools\n\n- Course is programming language-agnostic.\n- Assignments will have notebooks set up for Julia (environments, etc) on GitHub.\n\n## Some Tips For Success\n\n- Start the homeworks early; this gives time to sort out conceptual problems and debug.\n- Ask questions (in class and online) and try to help each other.\n- Give me feedback!\n\n# Upcoming Schedule\n\n## Next Classes\n\n- Hypothesis testing and decision-making\n- Generative models\n\n## Assessments\n\n**Homework 1** available; due *next* Friday (2/7).\n\n# References\n\n## References (Scroll for Full List)\n\n",
