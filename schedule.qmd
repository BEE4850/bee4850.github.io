This page contains a schedule of the topics, content, and assignments for the semester.
Note that this schedule will be updated as necessary the semester progresses, with all changes documented here.

Instructions to save the slides as PDFs can be found [here](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf). The key is to hit `E` when the slides are open in your browser (ideally Chrome, but it may work in others) to toggle into PDF print mode.

Readings can be accessed using the link (when needed, through the Cornell library with a Cornell login) or on Canvas.
